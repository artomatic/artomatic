Greetings!

I'm Art: a Web Developer in development in Charlotte, NC.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from UCLA and I'm currently finishing up my full-stack web development bootcamp with Bloomtech as I try to break into the promising world of the tech industry.

I'm also a political activist for a non-profit grassroots organization representing the Armenian Cause to North Carolinian Senators and Congressmen in DC.

Let you stumbling upon my page be the start of something great!
